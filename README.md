# Web-Dev-Journey
My journey of becoming a Full-Stack Web Developer from scratch. This repository documents everything I learn — from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to React, Node.js and backend development.  It includes: Mini projects to showcase my skills  and Live demo links for deployed projects. I’m committed to learning in public and sharing my growth step by step.
